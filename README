plato_if is a program to connect classic PLATO IV plasma terminals to
the PLATO system on the internet at cyberserv.org. This program runs
under Linux on an Intel Galileo board and uses a custom A9 board in the
PLATO terminal to connect the Galileo's spi1 device to the terminal
backplane.

This program also emulates the Gooch Synthetic Woodwind, which was a music
peripheral for the classic PLATO IV terminals.

This program is licensed under the GPL V2.
